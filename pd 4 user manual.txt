How the simulator works:

start with the preset sliders and adjust the slider to adjust the preset values (they are currently hardcoded for the json files)

click on preset to toggle off preset sliders and get to the regular ones. These you can slide to get different sonfication outputs, which differ based on the presetValue.

click on shoulder, wrist, and back buttons to activate the sliders. There will be no audio if they are not activated. You can also press them again to deactivate them.

Adjust the straightness slider to change the rate from the preset. This is done by changing the rate of the input using a static. which is hooked up to a soundPlayer.

Adjust the levelnessSlider to change how sharp or  flat the audio is from the preset. This is done using a filter that is hooked up to the gain and wavePlayer.

Adjust the heightSlider to change the volume from the preset. quieter is closer to preset. This is done using a gain change.

Adjust the alignment Slider to change the  volume from the preset. quieter is closer to preset and vice versa. This is done by hooking up the gain to a glide and the player to the gain and adjusting the gain.

The expansion slider autoclicks when the expansion is at the right spot. It it done using a gain that is hooked up to a soundPlayer.

click on the "shoot" button to activate tts. This is supposed to be used for when everything matches the preset values.
